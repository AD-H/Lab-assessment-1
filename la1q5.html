            A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically 
            carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation).<br>
            Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of <br>
            operations known as programs, which enable computers to perform a 
            wide range of tasks.

            The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete 
            computer that includes the hardware, operating <br>
            system, software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for full <br>
            operation, or to a group of computers that are linked and function 
            together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
